The content provided is a C++ program that performs certain operations on an array using a segment tree data structure. 

The program includes the necessary header files and defines some macros. It also defines some functions and variables to handle input and output and perform the required operations.

The main function reads the input, builds the segment tree, and then performs a series of operations based on the given input. The operations include modifying a range of elements in the array and querying the sum of elements in a range. The program uses lazy propagation to efficiently update the segment tree and avoid unnecessary calculations.

Finally, the program outputs the result of each query operation.
